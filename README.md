# Advent of Code
These are my solutions for [AOC 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025), written in Rust.

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a yearly programming challenge consisting of days of programming puzzles. AoC 2025 includes 12 puzzles.

# How to Run
This solution uses [cargo-aoc](https://github.com/gobanos/cargo-aoc) to run the solutions. Setup instructions can be found on their github page.

# Setup using ```nix-shell```
If you are using the [nix package manager](https://nixos.org/) you can use a [nix-shell](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.22/command-ref/nix-shell) to quickly and easily setup a working environment for running the code.
Just run ```nix-shell``` in the base directory of this repository.
